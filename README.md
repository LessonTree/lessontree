##Our Mission
LessonTree is a collaborative community of educators that seeks to promote the creation & distribution of high-quality educational materials.

##More Info
LessonTree is an open-source web application which utilizes a lesson sharing network in order to redefine how teachers create, edit, & share lessons amongst other educators & themselves. Our objective centers around maximizing non-teaching time outside of the classroom to increase efficiency.

LessonTree’s community network promotes accurate & usable rubrics, functional plans, highly vetted documentation, & lessens time constraints so that more effective teaching occurs inside the classroom.

Our collaborative workspace includes in-browser editing of documents & the ability to “branch” lessons to new projects in order to provide an all-inclusive, yet user friendly experience. The best part- it’s free! We hope you enjoy what LessonTree has to offer.
